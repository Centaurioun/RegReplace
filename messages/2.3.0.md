# RegReplace 2.3.0

## New

- Add new select action for searches.
- Backrefs has been moved to an external dependency which Package Control should automatically install.
- Latest backrefs dependency allows for using a lot more Unicode properties when using `extended_back_references` settings.  Also numerous fixes have been made improving the Unicode generated tables it uses.  In the future, Package Control may or may not automatically upgrade to the latest backrefs when desired.  If at any time yours is behind and you want to pull the latest, you can use Package Control's `Satisfy Dependency` found in the command palette.
