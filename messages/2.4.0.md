# RegReplace 2.4.0

## New

- `replacements` rules have now deprecated the options `case` and `dotall`.  These features can be configured using Python re's syntax of `(?i)` for case insensitivity and `(?s)` for dotall.  Legacy support still works but will be removed in the next non-bugfix release.

- `on_save_sequences`'s options `case` and `dotall` have been deprecated (this option specifically affected the `file_regex` option).  These features can be configured using Python re's syntax of `(?i)` for case insensitivity and `(?s)` for dotall.  Legacy support still works but will be removed in the next non-bugfix release, but there are some minor changes.

    THE `file_regex` OPTION'S LOGIC HAS BEEN REVERESED AND NOW ASSUMES PYTHON RE'S DEFAULT OF CASE SENSITIVITY. IT IS RECOMMENDED TO UPDATE YOUR `file_regex` SETTINGS BY USING THE NON-DEPRECATED SYNTAX OF INCLUDING `(?i)` IN YOUR REGEX.  YOU CAN ALSO USE THE DEPRECATED OPTION OF `"case": false`, BUT THIS IS DISCOURAGED.  PLEASE MAKE THE REQUIRED CHANGES!

    EXAMPLE: `".*\\.sublime-settings"` --> `"(?i).*\\.sublime-settings"`
