# RegReplace 2.2.0

## New
- rr_extended.py has been removed in favor of backrefs which adds support for numerous backrefs in regex expressions and improves the existing extra back references.
- Regex back references for upper case and lower case classes in search via `\c` and `\l` and the inverse can be done with `\L` and `\C`.
- Much improved support for title case back references in replace: `\l`, `\c`, `\L...\E`, and `\C...\E`.
- Quoting/escaping can be done in searches with `\Q...\E`.
- Unicode property support in searches has been added via `\p{Lu}` or a more verbose form `\p{Uppercase_Letter}`.  The inverses can be performed with `\P{Lu}` or `\P{Uppercase_Letter}`.

## Notes
Check out documentation for more information on the new and improved extended back reference support.
